        I like electronic music.
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jwhamilton99">I make my own</a>. I think
        it's pretty good, but that's for you to decide.<br /><br />My favorite
        electronic artists are Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada, Tycho, Solar
        Fields, Carbon Based Lifeforms, and Squarepusher.

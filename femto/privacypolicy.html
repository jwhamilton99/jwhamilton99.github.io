		<h1>Femto Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>Femto collects no data. There is no server associated with me to even allow that.</p>
		<p>To use Dropbox, Femto uses their HTTP API to log in/create new files.</p>
		<p>Using iCloud for file creation and opening files from other providers (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) goes through the Files app.</p>
		<p>I have no reason to want to see what you use Femto for. Just do your thing.</p>
